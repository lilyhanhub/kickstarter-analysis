# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns


## Overview  of Project: 
Perfoming analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends for Louice's project campaign. As Louise's play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Therefore, this analysis would help Louice see the outcomes and trends with data visualizaitons, so she can better prepare for her Kickstarter campaign.


## Analysis and Challenges: 
The analysis consists of two technical analysis deliverables: Outcomes Based on Launch Date Chart and Outcomes Based on Goals Chart. 
* Deliverable 1: Outcomes Based on Launch Date Chart
  * A new column labeled "Years" was created by extracting the year from the "Date Created Conversion" column of the Kickstarter worksheet.
  * A pivot table was created in a new worksheet labeled "Theater Outcomes by Launch Date" from the Kickstarter worksheet filtering by "Parent Category"
    and "Years", with Columns value "outcomes", Rows value "Date Created Conversion", and Values "Count of outcomes". 
  * Then the "Parent Category" was fllled by "theater".
  * The row lables were changed to display the months of the year, and the campaign outcomes were sorted in descending order.
  * Lastly, a line with markers chart was inserted showing the number of successful, failed, aor canceled projects by months, with a title "Theater 
    Outcomes based on Launch Date".
  For more information, See [the line with markers chart visualizing the relationship between outcomes and launch month.](/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png)
    
* Deliverable 2: Outcomes Based on Goals Chart
  * A new worksheet was created and labled "Outcomes Based on Goals", with eight columns: Goal, Number Successful, Number Failed, Number Canceled, Total
    Projects, Percentage Successful, Percentage Failed, Percentage Canceled. 
  * In the "Goal" column, twelve dollar-amount ranges from less than $1,000 to over $50,000 with a $5,000 increment were grouped. 
  * Then the "Number Successful", "Number Failed", and "Number Canceled" columns were populated by using COUNTIFS() funcations, with filters on the 
    Kickstarter worksheet "outcome" column, on the "goal" amount colunmn using the range groups, and on the "Subcategory" column using "plays" as the
    criteria. 
  * The "Total Projects" column was populated by using the SUM() function, and the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled projects for each row
    was calculated and populated.
  * Lastly, a line chart was inserted showing the pecentage of successful, failed, or canceled projects by the goal-amount ranges, with a title 
    "Outcomes Based on Goal".
  For more information, see [the line chart visualizing the relationship between outcomes and launch goals.](/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png)
  
* Challenges I 
explain how you performed your analysis using images and links to code, as well as any challenges you encountered and how you overcome them. If you had no challenges, describe any possible challenges or difficulites that could be encountered. 

##### Splitting the parent/subcategory column into two distinct columns "Parent category" and "Subcategory". So..... Line with markers charts can help Louice determine the trends. 

## Results:
#### 1. What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date?  
- The month that launched the most successful Kickstarter campaign in the theater category was May. 
- January, March, September, November and December all had roughly the same lowest number of failed campaigns launched, while May and October had roughly the same highest number of failed campaigns launched.
- The only month that lanuched theatre campaign without cancellation was October. 

#### 2.  What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
* There was no cancellation on the plays campaign. The campaigns whose goals were less than $1,000 were the most successful, followed by the goals in the range of $1,000-$4,999 and $35,000-$44,999ï¼›while the most failed campaigns whose goal were in the range of $45,000-$49,999. 

#### 3. What are some limitations of this dataset?
#### 4.  What are some other possbile tables and/or graphs that we could create?
